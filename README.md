# Largest-Number

By this Java code we can arrange number such that they form the largest number a list of non negative integers. 

Example 1:

Input: [10,2]
Output: "210"
Example 2:

Input: [3,30,34,5,9]
Output: "9534330"
Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.
